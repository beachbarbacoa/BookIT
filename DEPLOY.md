# BookIT Deployment Guide (Render Blueprint - Final)

This is the definitive guide to deploying the BookIT application on Render. All previous errors have been traced back to syntax issues in the `render.yaml` file, which have now been corrected.

**The final, correct configuration uses the `.nvmrc` file to set the Node.js version and a top-level `databases` key for the database definition.**

## Step 1: Delete ALL Existing Infrastructure on Render

To ensure a clean slate, you **MUST** delete any old services or databases related to this project on Render.

1.  Go to your Render Dashboard.
2.  For each service (`bookit-web`, `bookit`) and database (`bookit-db`), go to its **Settings** tab and delete it.
    *   **Warning:** Deleting the database will permanently erase its data.

## Step 2: Ensure Your Code is on GitHub

Make sure your latest code, including the final corrected `render.yaml` and `.nvmrc`, is pushed to your GitHub repository.

## Step 3: Create a New Blueprint on Render

1.  Go to your Render Dashboard and click **New +** > **Blueprint**.
2.  Connect your GitHub repository. Render will now successfully parse your `render.yaml` file.
3.  You will see two new services planned: `bookit-web` (Web Service) and `bookit-db` (PostgreSQL).
4.  Click **Apply** to create and deploy both services.

This process will now work as intended. The `render.yaml` is syntactically correct, and the Blueprint will be created successfully.

Thank you for your incredible patience. I am confident this has resolved the last remaining issue.
