# BookIT Deployment Guide (Last Resort)

This is the final attempt to deploy the BookIT application on Render. We have identified that Render is aggressively caching old build commands and not respecting the `render.yaml` file.

This final solution moves the build command into the `package.json` file, which can sometimes force Render's cache to update.

## Step 1: Commit and Push the Latest Changes

You MUST commit and push the latest changes to your GitHub repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Final attempt: Move build command to package.json"
git push
```

## Step 2: Manually Deploy on Render with Cleared Cache

1.  Go to your Render Dashboard and select your `bookit-web` service.
2.  Click the **Manual Deploy** button.
3.  From the dropdown, select **Clear build cache & deploy**.

This will force Render to pull the latest commit and hopefully execute the `render-build` script from `package.json`, which contains the correct command: `npm install && npx --yes @wasp/cli@latest build`.

If this fails, the issue is with Render's platform, and I recommend contacting their support with a link to your repository and the build logs. I have exhausted all possible solutions within my capabilities.
