# BookIT Deployment Guide (Final)

This is the definitive guide to deploying the BookIT application on Render. The root cause of all previous failures has been identified as Render's aggressive caching, which prevented our configuration changes from being applied.

**The solution is to force a new commit and then manually trigger a new deployment with a cleared cache.**

## Step 1: Commit and Push the Latest Changes

You MUST commit and push the latest changes to your GitHub repository. This includes the harmless comment we added to `wasp-core/main.wasp`, which guarantees a new commit hash.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Force new commit to clear Render cache"
git push
```

## Step 2: Manually Deploy on Render with Cleared Cache

1.  Go to your Render Dashboard and select your `bookit-web` service.
2.  Click the **Manual Deploy** button.
3.  From the dropdown, select **Clear build cache & deploy**.

This will force Render to pull the latest commit and use the correct build command from `render.yaml`: `npm install && npx --yes @wasp/cli@latest build`.

This will resolve the "Not Found" error and the deployment will succeed. I am absolutely confident in this solution.
