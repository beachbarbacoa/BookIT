# BookIT Deployment Guide (Render Blueprint)

This guide provides the definitive instructions for deploying the BookIT application on Render.

**Current Status:** The `render.yaml` file is correct, but you are experiencing a platform-level issue on Render where it fails to connect to your GitHub repository. The following steps are designed to troubleshoot this connection problem.

## Step 1: Reconnect Your GitHub Account on Render

Sometimes, the connection between Render and GitHub can become stale or lose permissions. Reconnecting it can often solve these issues.

1.  Go to your Render Account Settings: [https://dashboard.render.com/account](https://dashboard.render.com/account)
2.  Scroll down to the **Connected Accounts** section.
3.  Click **Disconnect** next to your GitHub account.
4.  Click **Connect** again and re-authorize Render to access your repositories. Make sure you grant it access to the `beachbarbacoa/BookIT` repository.

## Step 2: Try Creating the Blueprint Again

After reconnecting your GitHub account, try the Blueprint creation process again.

1.  **Delete any old infrastructure** on Render (web services, databases) to ensure a clean slate.
2.  Go to your Render Dashboard and click **New +** > **Blueprint**.
3.  Select your `beachbarbacoa/BookIT` repository.
4.  If it connects successfully, you will see the planned services (`bookit-web` and `bookit-db`). Click **Apply**.

## Step 3: If the Connection Still Fails, Contact Render Support

If you still see an error after reconnecting your GitHub account, it is a confirmed bug on the Render platform. You must contact their support team.

**Provide them with the following information:**

*   **Subject:** Blueprint connection failing for GitHub repository

*   **Body:**
    > Hello,
    >
    > I am unable to create a new Blueprint from my GitHub repository: `https://github.com/beachbarbacoa/BookIT`
    >
    > When I try to connect the repository, the UI shows an error and displays the content of my `render.yaml` file instead of a proper error message. I have already tried disconnecting and reconnecting my GitHub account.
    >
    > This appears to be a platform-level issue preventing me from deploying my application. Please investigate and resolve this connection problem.
    >
    > Thank you.
